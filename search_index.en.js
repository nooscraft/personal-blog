I Am\nI'm Oshadha, a senior engineer passionate about building reliable, performant systems. My journey started in Java—Spring, Spring Boot, microservices, you name it. I cut my teeth on enterprise Java applications and learned the art of distributed systems the hard way.\nBut recently, I've been fascinated by Rust—its speed, memory safety, and the compiler's refreshingly rude honesty. I'm now diving deep into Rust with personal projects, exploring systems programming from a new angle. But I know my roots, and those Java lessons still shape how I think about architecture.\nIn my day job, I'm mostly into efforts—overseeing in AI/ML, building, and planning AI/ML pipelines for targeted clients. It's about battling the unknowns behind this new frontier and shaping features that grab users' attention. The journey from Java to AI to Rust has taught me that the best engineers aren't defined by their language, but by their ability to solve problems.\nThis blog, Noos, is where I share my thoughts on technology, engineering practices, and the occasional hard-won lesson from the trenches.\nWhat I Write About\nMy content spans:\n\nJava &amp; Spring: Enterprise patterns, microservices architecture, and lessons from building large-scale systems\nRust: Exploring systems programming, memory safety, and the Rust ecosystem as I learn\nAI/ML Engineering: Building robust ML pipelines, tackling the unknowns, and shipping production ML systems\nLinux &amp; Open Source: Terminal workflows, system configuration, and the tools I use daily\nDevOps: CI/CD, infrastructure, automation, and the realities of deployment\n\nI write from experience, not theory.

For me it was cover images. Each new post: open a design tool, stare at a blank canvas, export a PNG, wire it to the post. Not hard, just enough friction to make publishing feel heavier than it should.\nThis is a short note about shaving that yak with a tiny toolchain: a context‑aware prompt, an image model, and some guardrails in CI. No heroics—just removing a repeated decision so the writing flows.\nWhy automate covers\n\nConsistency: 1200×630 every time. No more odd crops in link unfurls.\nMomentum: publishing shouldn’t wait for “design time”.\nStyle: light background, a single accent, abstract shapes. Enough personality, zero fuss.\n\nOver time the manual step was turning into a speed bump. That was the whole motivation.\nThe bumps along the road (the important part)\nI didn’t get it right on the first try. Here are the lessons that actually mattered.\n\nModel and limits\n\nAt first I used Stable Horde for SDXL. It’s great and free, but CI doesn’t love queues. I kept seeing 400/429s in the logs (invalid payload or rate‑limited). Switched to Replicate with an API token; still got rate limits sometimes, but at least the errors were predictable.\n\nExact sizing\n\nSDXL likes multiples of 64. I request 1024×576, then downscale to 1200×630 with Sharp. Crisp edges, correct aspect for social cards.\n\nSlugs vs. filenames\n\nMy fallback logic assumed page.slug exactly matched the filename. It didn’t—some posts derive the slug from the permalink. I fixed the template to compute slug-from-permalink and look for /images/covers/{slug}.png. Simple, but that bug cost the most time.\n\n“Why is it regenerating?”\n\nCI starts from a clean checkout. If covers aren’t in Git, they disappear each run. I added a cache step that restores static/images/covers keyed to content/posts/**/*.md. Now the generator truly skips when a PNG already exists.\n\nContext in prompts\n\nPure tags produced vague images. I added a little context: title + ~240 chars of summary (description if present, otherwise a clean slice of the body). Still abstract, just more grounded.\n\nOne‑time resets\n\nSometimes you do want a full refresh. There’s a manual “Run workflow” input (force_regenerate=true) that bypasses the “file exists” check once. Good for style changes or a model upgrade.\nHow we decided on AI at all\nI tried three options in order:\n\nHand‑made banners (historically): high quality, low velocity.\nProgrammatic shapes: reliable, but too repetitive.\nAI with guardrails: abstract, brand‑aware, hands‑off once it’s set.\n\nThe third option hit the balance. The prompt constrains style; the model supplies variation. It’s not “art direction”, but it serves the post—and that’s the only job here.\nThe pipeline (nuts and bolts)\n\n\nScript: scripts/generate-ai-covers.mjs\n\nScans content/posts/*.md, pulls tags, title, and a short summary.\nPrompt (simplified):\n\nAbstract, minimal illustration. Tags: {tags}. Title: {title}. Context: {summary}. Vector‑like, clean geometric shapes, high contrast, brand accent #d64a48 on #f6f7f4. No text.\n\n\nCalls Replicate SDXL (model version from a secret), requests 1024×576, saves 1200×630 as static/images/covers/{slug}.png.\nSkips generation if the PNG already exists (unless FORCE_REGENERATE_COVERS=1).\n\n\n\nTemplate: themes/radion/templates/page.html\n\nIf a post doesn’t specify a cover, it tries /images/covers/{slug-from-permalink}.png and hides the figure if missing.\n\n\n\nCI: .github/workflows/deploy.yml\n\nRestores a covers cache before generation; saves it after.\nOptional manual input force_regenerate for a one‑time refresh.\n\n\n\nWhat GitHub Actions brings\nThe boring kind of power: reliability.\n\nEvery run restores the previous covers, generates only what’s missing, and embeds without a front‑matter tweak.\nWhen rate‑limited, the post still publishes—missing images pick up on the next run.\nA small verification stage lists the covers in public/images/covers and checks that posts actually reference them.\n\nClosing the loop\nThis wasn’t about making the site “AI‑powered”. It was about removing a tiny friction point that kept breaking the flow. The rule of thumb I keep coming back to: automate anything that steals attention from writing. Covers were stealing attention. Now they aren’t.\nAnd if the art ever needs a new feel? I flip the model or tweak the prompt, hit “Run workflow”, and let the pipeline repaint the edges while I get back to words.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/ai-covers-on-autopilot/","title":"Covers on Autopilot — Why I Let AI Paint the Edges"},"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":"Intro\nSo you own an up and running Amazon EC2 instance. And you want it to access via hassle free way. This guided post will describe on how you can do it with few steps.\nNote: Just for the convenience I'm referring some steps from this blog here\nOK before I start assume you have an up and running EC2 instance. If so grab the public DNS from your AWS management console\n\nIt will be probably something like\nec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nOnce that is acquired I again assume you have already made your Key-pair and saved it while you are in the process of creating a new instance\n\nOnce that is also in place go to your terminal and CD to the location you saved your Key [your-key-pair.pem] and try to do SSH.\n$ ssh -i your-key-pair.pem ubuntu@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\n[the default user will be ubuntu for Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)]\nNow you should be inside the AMS terminal\n\nOk now you have to do is add your self up as a new user and give the root privileges (sudoers). Simply follow execute the following commands on to the AWS terminal\nAdding yourself as a user:\n$ adduser yourself\ngranting privileges\n$ sudo visudo\nfind the line root  ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL and the line yourself ALL=(ALL) ALL under it.\nThen enable password authentication via (I used the nano editor)\n$ sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nPasswordAuthentication no to PasswordAuthentication yes\nAfterward reload the ssh configuration\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nOK now logout from the current session and log back as yourself\n$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nAnd to make sure everything is working just fine, execute following\n$ sudo -v\nYou will be promted to enter the password you have provided while creating the user(yourself). Enter that and if everything went well you will get no output on terminal.\nNow lets remove this troublesome password authentication replacing SSH RSA public key authentication\nTo do that first you need to create a SSH RSA public key\nSo logout from the AWS terminal and from your local terminal execute the following command (Just press return for all the steps)\nlocal-host$ ssh-keygen -t rsa\nAnd you will be promted as below\n\nNow what you have to do is add that key to AWS in order to identify yourself as authorize user.\nlocal-host$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nThen again login to the AWS\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############..compute-1.amazonaws.com:/home/yourself\nAnd place the key file in right place\n\nNow you should be able to login without using a password\nlocal-host$ ssh yourself@ec2-#############.compute-1.amazonaws.com\nFinally remove the password authentication and root user access\n$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config\nFind the line PasswordAuthentication yes and change it to PasswordAuthentication no\nAlso PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no\nFinally reload the SSH configurations again\n$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh reload\nThat's all you need for crating a new user account and allowing authentication via SSH RSA.\nIf you are still lazy enough to type that long public DNS you can simply assign it to an alias and place it in the ~/.bash_proflle  or ~/.bashrc to make it permanent.\n\n$ connect-amazon\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/","title":"Amazon WS EC2 – connect via SSH RSA"},"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/":{"body":"While I was fooling around the Play store I found this recently released nice, simple and very addictive game. It's called the Dots. The funny thing about this game is that once you get started playing it you won't feel bored even it just has to do the same thing over and over again.\nThe experience that I felt was somewhat different from other games I have played before (but this could be only me). I think the main psychological factor that keeps me in the game is its simplicity and the options you get to boost your score and the opportunity you get to use those options. So there should be also a bit of a planning involved.\nTalking about the game basics there are two game mods \"Time mode\" and \"Moves mode\". In time mode there's a timer which runs for 60 seconds for a single round, so all your connecting skills should be used in this time frame. And in moves mode you'll get 30 moves to scream at in a round. I usually go with the Time mode because it is fun and challenging.\nOnce you filled your bucket with enough earned dots you can go ahead and acquire one or more above mentioned options. They call these options as Power Ups.\nHere I will list those Power Ups\n\nTime Stops: With this Power Up you can hold off your timer for 5 seconds and it requires 1000 dots for 5 tryouts. It's a pretty neat Power Up by the way. (In moves mode you'll get extra five moves)\nShrinkers: This Power Up just shrinks any dot from the board. You just have to double tap on a dot. It requires 500 dots for five tryouts and can be used only once in a round.\nExpanders: This Power Up I haven't used yet. As described it removes all the same color dots. It requires 5000 dots for five tryouts. This Power Up will definitely come in handy.\n\nThat's pretty much it about this beautiful game. If you are bored or trying to eat up some free time this game will certainly do the job for you.\nSo here's the Play store URL give it a try\nUPDATE\nI noticed something new in the game's About section. Actually it was already there but I wasn't so curious to check it out.\nThere are few sections, most of them has quotes of wisdom by an admired person.  But one of them has this funny little dots of all colors and you can tap on them, which will eventually makes a unique sound for each dot.\n\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/","title":"Connecting Dots"},"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/":{"body":"Cursor is a powerful AI-powered code editor that many developers are excited about. However, one aspect that consistently causes confusion is its payment and pricing model. This post attempts to document some of these confusions based on recent experiences.\nThe Confusion\nThe payment structure for Cursor can be unclear in several ways:\n\nFree tier limits: What exactly counts toward your monthly quota? Is it AI completions, chat requests, or something else?\nBilling cycles: When does your quota reset? Is it calendar month, or from when you first started using the service?\nPayment methods: What payment options are available, and how are they processed?\nUsage tracking: How can you monitor your usage to avoid unexpected charges or hitting limits?\n\nThese ambiguities can lead to surprises—either unexpected charges or finding yourself blocked when you thought you had quota remaining.\nWhy This Matters\nFor developers evaluating whether to adopt Cursor, understanding the cost and payment structure is important. Unclear pricing creates friction and can be a barrier to adoption, especially for individual developers or small teams on tight budgets.\nWhat to Do\nIf you're considering Cursor:\n\nCheck the official pricing page (cursor.sh/pricing) for current information\nMonitor your usage if there's a dashboard or settings page that shows quota\nReach out to support if you're confused about billing or limits\nDocument what you learn since this information may not be clearly documented\n\nImportant Disclaimer\n⚠️ Please note: Pricing, payment structures, and feature availability for Cursor are subject to change. The information in this post reflects experiences at the time of writing and may be outdated by the time you read this. Always refer to Cursor's official documentation and pricing pages for the most current information.\nThe goal of this post is to highlight that these aspects can be confusing, not to provide definitive answers that may become incorrect over time.\n\nIf you've experienced similar confusion with Cursor's pricing or payment model, you're not alone. Hopefully, this clarity improves as the platform matures.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/","title":"The Confusing World of Cursor Payments"},"https://noos.blog/posts/gh-actions-charges/":{"body":"If you received an email from GitHub about upcoming pricing changes for GitHub Actions, you might be wondering: \"Are they going to start charging me for something that was free?\" The short answer: It depends on what you're using, but for most people, the news is actually good.\nLet me break down what's changing in plain language, so you can understand how it affects your projects.\n\nThe Big Question: Is GitHub Actions Still Free?\nYes—for public repositories, GitHub Actions remains completely free. If you're using GitHub Actions in public repositories (like open-source projects), nothing changes. You can continue using it without any charges.\nThis is important because many developers and organizations rely on GitHub Actions for open-source projects, and GitHub has committed to keeping that free.\n\nWhat's Actually Changing?\nGitHub is making two main changes, both scheduled for 2026:\n1. Price Reductions (January 1, 2026)\nGood news: GitHub is reducing prices for GitHub-hosted runners in private repositories by up to 39%, depending on the machine type you use.\nIf you're currently paying for GitHub Actions in private repositories, your costs will go down. This is a straightforward price cut—no catch.\n2. New Platform Charge for Self-Hosted Runners (March 1, 2026)\nThis is the one that might affect you: GitHub will introduce a new $0.002 per-minute \"cloud platform\" charge for self-hosted runners.\nWait—what's a self-hosted runner? If you're using your own servers or machines to run GitHub Actions (instead of GitHub's cloud infrastructure), those are self-hosted runners. Most individual developers and small teams use GitHub-hosted runners, so this won't affect them.\nImportant details:\n\nThis charge only applies to self-hosted runners (your own machines)\nThe charge is $0.002 per minute (that's 0.2 cents per minute)\nEven with this charge, it still counts against the minutes already included in your GitHub plan\n\nWhat does that last point mean? If you have a GitHub plan that includes 2,000 minutes per month, and you use 500 minutes on self-hosted runners, you'll pay the $0.002/minute charge, but those 500 minutes still count toward your 2,000-minute allowance. You're not being double-charged.\n\nQuick Reference: Pricing Summary\nHere's a simple breakdown of what's changing:\nTypeStatus After Update\nPublic repo GitHub-hosted✅ Still free\nPrivate repo GitHub-hosted🔻 Price reduced (up to 39%)\nSelf-hosted runners💲 $0.002/min platform charge\nEnterprise Server customers✅ No change\n\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nPublic repositories: No change—still free\nPrivate repositories (GitHub-hosted): You'll pay less—prices dropping up to 39%\nSelf-hosted runners: New $0.002/min charge (~$0.12/hour). Calculate based on your usage\nEnterprise Server: No changes\n\n\nWhy the Change?\nGitHub hasn't provided detailed reasoning, but the new charge for self-hosted runners likely reflects the infrastructure costs of managing the platform, security, and integration features that make self-hosted runners work seamlessly with GitHub Actions—even when the actual compute happens on your machines.\nThe price reduction for GitHub-hosted runners suggests GitHub is optimizing their infrastructure and passing those savings to customers.\n\nWhat Should You Do?\n\n\nCheck your usage: If you're using self-hosted runners, review how many minutes you typically use per month to estimate the new cost.\n\n\nReview your plan: Make sure you understand what's included in your current GitHub plan (free, Pro, Team, or Enterprise).\n\n\nCalculate impact: For self-hosted runners, multiply your monthly minutes by $0.002 to see the additional cost. For example:\n\n1,000 minutes/month = $2.00/month\n5,000 minutes/month = $10.00/month\n\n\n\nConsider alternatives: If the new charge significantly impacts your costs, you might want to evaluate whether self-hosted runners are still the best option, or if GitHub-hosted runners (which are getting cheaper) might work for your needs.\n\n\n\nThe Bottom Line\nFor most users, these changes are either neutral (public repos stay free) or positive (private repo prices go down). The only group that will see new charges is those using self-hosted runners, and even then, the charge is relatively small.\nThe key takeaway: GitHub Actions isn't going away, and it's not suddenly becoming expensive. The changes are targeted and mostly beneficial. If you're concerned about costs, take some time to review your usage patterns and plan accordingly before the changes take effect in 2026.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGitHub Actions Pricing – Official pricing documentation\nGitHub Actions Usage Limits – Understanding included minutes and limits\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/gh-actions-charges/","title":"GitHub Actions Won't Charge You (Probably)"},"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/":{"body":"When you first set up GitHub Actions for a project, it feels like magic. Push your code, and the CI/CD pipeline takes care of everything—building, testing, deploying. But sometimes, the magic breaks. And when it does, you learn things you never expected to learn.\nI recently went through a journey with GitHub Actions that taught me a lot about the gap between \"this should work\" and \"this actually works.\" Here's what I learned, without exposing too many project details.\n\nBackground: Building with Zola\nFor context, this blog is built using Zola, a static site generator written in Rust. Zola takes Markdown files and templates, processes them, and outputs a static HTML site. It's fast, simple, and doesn't require a runtime—just compile your site and serve the static files.\nThe deployment process is straightforward:\n\nWrite content in Markdown\nRun zola build to generate static HTML\nDeploy the generated files to a hosting service\n\nThis makes Zola an ideal candidate for GitHub Pages: you build once, deploy the static files, and GitHub Pages serves them. The challenge comes when you want to automate this process with GitHub Actions.\nThe Promise of Automation\nGitHub Actions promises a lot:\n\nAutomatic builds on every push\nConsistent deployment environments\nLess manual work, fewer human errors\nIntegration with GitHub Pages for static sites\n\nThe setup looks straightforward:\n\nCreate a .github/workflows/deploy.yml file\nDefine your build steps\nPush and watch it work\n\nBut reality has a way of complicating things.\n\nIssue #1: The Submodule Problem\nOne of the first issues I encountered was related to git submodules. If your project includes external dependencies managed as submodules, GitHub Actions needs explicit configuration to handle them.\nThe Error:\n\nThe Root Cause:\nGitHub Actions tries to fetch submodules by default, but if your .gitmodules file is missing or incomplete, or if the submodule path exists but isn't properly configured, the build fails.\nThe Solution:\nIf you're not actually using submodules (maybe you copied files directly), you have two options:\n\n\nRemove the submodule completely:\n\n\n\nConfigure GitHub Actions to skip submodules:\n\n\n\nI went with option 1 because I wasn't actually using submodules—I had copied the theme files directly into the repository. The submodule reference was leftover from an earlier setup.\n\nIssue #2: Branch Confusion\nGitHub Pages supports two deployment methods:\n\nGitHub Actions: Build your site using a workflow\nBranch-based: Serve files directly from a branch (like gh-pages)\n\nI started with GitHub Actions, but ran into issues. The build kept failing, and debugging CI/CD pipelines can be frustrating—you push, wait, check logs, repeat.\nThe Revelation:\nSometimes, manual deployment to a gh-pages branch is simpler and more reliable. You get:\n\nFull control over when and how you deploy\nAbility to test locally before deploying\nNo hidden automation surprises\nEasier debugging (you can inspect the built files directly)\n\nThe Manual Approach:\n\nIs this less \"modern\"? Maybe. But it's transparent, predictable, and gives you control when you need it.\n\nUpdate: Automation Wins After All\nAfter writing the initial version of this post, I realized something: maintaining two branches manually was becoming a burden. The workflow was reliable, but it required:\n\nRemembering to switch branches\nRunning build commands\nManually syncing files\nSwitching back to main\n\nThe Solution:\nI revisited GitHub Actions, but this time with a clear understanding of the issues:\n\nConfigured submodules properly (submodules: false since we don't use them)\nUsed a reliable deployment action (peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)\nSet up the workflow to trigger on push to main\n\nThe Result:\nNow I just push to main, and GitHub Actions handles everything:\n\nBuilds the site automatically\nDeploys to gh-pages branch\nUpdates GitHub Pages\n\nWhat Changed:\nThe key was understanding the submodule issue first. Once that was resolved, the automation became reliable. The workflow is simple and transparent—I can see exactly what's happening in the Actions tab.\nThe Lesson:\nSometimes automation does make sense. The difference between my first attempt and my second attempt was:\n\nUnderstanding the root causes (submodules, branch setup)\nUsing proven, maintained actions\nStarting simple and adding complexity only when needed\n\nThe manual approach taught me what was happening under the hood. That knowledge made the automation reliable.\n\nIssue #3: Missing Scripts and Assets\nWhen deploying to GitHub Pages, you need to ensure all your assets are included. This might seem obvious, but it's easy to miss.\nThe Problem:\nYour site builds locally, but when deployed, certain features don't work—like a theme toggle button that does nothing, or search functionality that's broken.\nThe Cause:\nJavaScript files weren't being included in the HTML. The build process generated the files, but the HTML templates weren't referencing them correctly, or the script tags were missing entirely.\nThe Fix:\nManually verify that all necessary scripts are loaded:\n\nCheck your HTML templates\nEnsure script tags are in the correct order\nVerify paths are correct (especially for GitHub Pages subdirectory paths)\n\nSometimes, the simplest solution is to open the generated HTML and check what's actually there.\n\nIssue #4: The Abstraction Trap\nHere's the thing about automation: when it works, it's great. When it doesn't, you're debugging an abstraction layer you may not fully understand.\nThe Pattern:\n\nSomething breaks\nYou check GitHub Actions logs\nYou see an error message\nYou make a change\nYou push and wait\nRepeat\n\nThis cycle can be slow, especially if your builds take a few minutes each time.\nThe Alternative:\nWith manual deployment:\n\nBuild locally (instant feedback)\nTest locally\nDeploy when ready\nInspect the deployed files directly\n\nThe feedback loop is faster, and you understand every step.\n\nIssue #5: GitHub Pages Source Branch Mismatch\nEven after getting the deployment pipeline working, some issues only surfaced when viewing the site in production. These weren't build failures—they were configuration problems.\nThe GitHub Pages Source Branch Mismatch\nThe Symptom:\nAfter deploying fixes, the blog post updates weren't appearing on the live site. The build succeeded, GitHub Actions showed successful deployment, but visiting the site showed old content.\nThe Root Cause:\nGitHub Pages has two deployment methods:\n\nGitHub Actions - Pages builds from Actions workflow output\nBranch-based - Pages serves files directly from a branch (like gh-pages)\n\nThe problem was a configuration mismatch: GitHub Pages was set to use \"GitHub Actions\" as the source, but our workflow was deploying to the gh-pages branch. GitHub Pages was trying to serve from the Actions output, not the branch we were deploying to.\nThe Fix:\nChanged GitHub Pages source back to gh-pages branch in repository settings:\n\nGo to repository Settings → Pages\nUnder \"Source\", select \"Deploy from a branch\"\nChoose gh-pages branch and / (root) folder\nSave\n\nWhy This Happened:\nWhen you first set up GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages might automatically switch to \"GitHub Actions\" mode. If your workflow deploys to gh-pages branch (which is common), you need to ensure the Pages source matches where you're deploying.\nThe Lesson:\nAlways verify that your GitHub Pages source matches your deployment target. If your Actions workflow deploys to gh-pages, make sure Pages is configured to serve from that branch. Configuration mismatches can cause silent failures where everything appears to work but content doesn't update.\nTesting Across Browsers\nThe Problem:\nDifferent browsers cache differently. Chrome might show updated content while Firefox shows old content, or vice versa. However, in this case, the issue wasn't browser caching—it was a configuration mismatch.\nThe Solution:\n\nAlways verify GitHub Pages source matches your deployment method\nCheck GitHub Actions logs to confirm deployment succeeded\nWait 2-5 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild after deployment\nUse hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R) when testing\nTest in multiple browsers to rule out caching issues\n\nWhat I Learned:\n\nGitHub Pages configuration must match your deployment method\nAlways verify the deployment target matches the Pages source\nTesting locally doesn't catch configuration mismatches\n\n\nWhen to Use GitHub Actions\nDon't get me wrong—GitHub Actions is powerful and useful. Use it when:\n\nYou need automated testing on every commit\nYou want consistent build environments\nMultiple people are deploying\nYou need to run expensive operations (like building large projects)\nYou want to enforce code quality checks\n\nBut consider manual deployment when:\n\nYour build process is simple\nYou want full control\nYou're deploying infrequently\nYou want to understand every step\nDebugging automation is slowing you down\n\n\nLessons Learned\n\n\nUnderstand your dependencies: Know whether you're using submodules, npm packages, or other external resources. This affects your CI/CD setup.\n\n\nTest locally first: Always build and test your site locally before relying on automation. Automation catches mistakes, but you should catch them first.\n\n\nKeep it simple: If automation adds complexity without clear benefits, consider if manual processes might be better for your use case.\n\n\nInspect the output: When something doesn't work, look at the actual generated files. HTML errors, missing assets, and broken links are often visible in the source.\n\n\nVerify GitHub Pages configuration matches deployment: If your Actions workflow deploys to gh-pages branch, ensure GitHub Pages source is set to that branch. Configuration mismatches cause silent failures.\n\n\nTest across browsers: Different browsers cache differently. Always test in multiple browsers after deployment, and use hard refresh when debugging.\n\n\nDocument your process: Whether you use automation or manual deployment, document it. Future you (and your team) will thank you.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nGitHub Actions is a powerful tool, but it's not always the right tool—at least not immediately. My journey started with frustration, moved to manual control, and ended with successful automation.\nThe manual approach wasn't wasted effort. It taught me:\n\nWhat was happening under the hood\nHow the build process worked\nWhat could go wrong and why\n\nThat knowledge made the automation reliable. When I returned to GitHub Actions, I understood the root causes and could configure it correctly.\nThe key is to choose the approach that fits your project, your team, and your workflow. Sometimes that means starting manually to understand the process, then automating once you know what you're automating.\nAt the end of the day, the goal is to deploy reliably and efficiently. Whether that's through GitHub Actions, manual commands, or a hybrid approach, what matters is that it works for you—and that you understand why it works.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nGitHub Actions Documentation – Official documentation\nGitHub Pages Deployment – Deployment strategies\nManaging Git Submodules – Git submodule basics\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/","title":"GitHub Actions: When Automation Meets Reality"},"https://noos.blog/posts/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":"Intro\nAs you may have already know the latest distribution release of OpenSUSE 12.1 ships with Google Go language. Go language was founded by Google as their very own programming language. It works like an interpreter language yet it has to be compiled in order to execute. This small introduction will show you how to set up the environment and run your first Go language program.\nInstalling Go\nActually Go language is a part of the SUSE 12.1 distribution so you will not get it out of the box that is you have to install it first in order to use it. So lets begin installing Go\nsudo zypper install go\nHere I have issued the zypper command to install the Go (usual SUSE way of installing packages from repos). It will probably install two packages. Ok after the successful installation lets check if it's available\nwhereis go\noutputs\ngo: /usr/lib/go /usr/share/go\nVoila.! so we got installed Go\nSetting up the environment\nAs in the Go guided tutorial mentioned we need to set up three environment variables in order to successfully compile and execute a Go program. So lets open up the /.bashrc file where you usually place your environment variables (because /.bashrc file executes with every new session)\nsudo nano ~/.bashrc\nplace three environment variables on the bottom of the file:-\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nexport GOROOT – location of your Go source installation (/usr/lib/go) use whereis command to see that as used before.\nexport GOOS – Your OS type which is Linux\nexport GOARCH – Your OS architecture, in my case x86-32 (32-bit) so it goes as 386 [see here for more details]. Issue lscpu to check your sys-architecture.\nOk now everything is setup up. All you have to do now is open a new session, simply logout and re-login. or simply do a source ~/.bashrc\nFirst program\nAs this is an introduction I will grab the same \"Hello\" program listed on http://golang.org/doc/install.html#writing\nnano hello.go\n\n[ctrl + x to save the file]\nAs I did mentioned earlier Go is a compile and run language like C or C++. So you'll have to to take the necessary steps before you make your Go code to be executed.\nCompiling, linking and executing\n\nWill gives you\nhello, world\n\nNote: here I have used 8g, 8l because my arc-type is 32-bit (386).\nYou will notice a different formation on the guide.\n\nNow you have successfully completed your first Google Go language program. Pretty straight forward hah? To me it seems like that it follows a familiar executing process as in assembly language. So this is just a little heads up you can find more tutorials and code sample on http://golang.org/doc/\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/","title":"Google Go on OpenSUSE 12.1"},"https://noos.blog/posts/hieratic-prompt-compression-prototype/":{"body":"Why Even Bother Compressing Prompts?\nLarge prompts are the new monoliths.\nIf you’ve ever tried to stuff a serious extraction spec, a few pages of dense tables or configs, and long-running conversation history into a single LLM call, you already know the pain:\n\nContext windows get cramped.\nTokens get expensive.\nLatency creeps up.\nAnd the “just add more context” strategy quietly stops scaling.\n\nHieratic Prompt Compression is my attempt to push back on that—without spinning up yet another LLM just to shrink prompts. It’s being explored as an experimental feature for Tokuin, my CLI for token estimation and provider-aware load testing (GitHub).\nThe core question of this post:\nCan we build a deterministic, structure-aware compression layer that shrinks prompts by 50–80% while preserving downstream task fidelity?\nAnd maybe more importantly: is it worth doing, or is this just an over-engineered curiosity?\nThis is not a feature announcement. It’s a proposal in public, and I’d like your help pressure-testing it.\n\nWhy “Hieratic”?\nThe name “Hieratic” comes from the hieratic script used in ancient Egypt: a compact, scribal shorthand for hieroglyphs that preserved meaning while being much faster to write.\nThat’s roughly the spirit here:\n\nWe want a compact, structured shorthand for long prompts.\nWe care about preserving the semantic load, not the surface form.\nWe want something a “scribal” system can produce deterministically, instead of asking another model to improvise a summary.\n\nHieratic is meant to be that shorthand: a structured, compressed representation of your original prompt that an LLM can still “read” effectively.\n\nWhat I’m Proposing (in Plain Terms)\nThe rough sketch is:\n\nA non-LLM, structure-aware compression pipeline that:\n\ntreats instructions and structured documents differently,\naggressively removes boilerplate,\nreuses repeated snippets via a context library,\nand supports incremental compression over long histories.\n\n\nMore concretely:\n\n\nExtractive, not generative\nWe’re not asking another model to “summarize” the prompt. We’re selectively dropping low-value text and keeping the high-signal bits intact.\n\n\nStructure-aware\nJSON, HTML tables, and BNF-like grammars are treated as verbatim document blocks. Only the natural language instructions around them get compressed.\n\n\nLibrary-driven boilerplate removal\nRepeated extraction instructions, legal boilerplate, or scaffolding can be recognized and replaced by compact references using a reusable context library.\n\n\nIncremental compression\nFor long-running flows, only the newly dropped parts of the conversation get compressed into anchored summaries. We don’t re-summarize the entire history on every call.\n\n\nThe output is a “Hieratic” prompt: a compact, structured representation that the application can expand or feed directly into an LLM.\n\nWhy This Might Be Worth Doing\nFrom a product and engineering standpoint, a feature like this could unlock some real benefits:\n\n\nToken savings at scale\nIf you’re sending the same extraction spec or long policy docs over and over, shaving 50–80% of that cost starts to matter.\n\n\nLonger, richer prompts\nA smaller prompt budget per call means:\n\nMore examples,\nMore “why this matters” context,\nMore system-level constraints,\nwithout immediately slamming into context window limits.\n\n\n\nLatency and stability\nFewer tokens → lower latency, more predictable runtime, fewer timeouts and retries.\n\n\nDeterminism &amp; debuggability\nCompression is rule-based:\n\nSame input → same compressed output.\nEasy to diff and inspect what was kept vs dropped.\nFailure modes can be reasoned about and tested explicitly.\n\n\n\nBetter fit for structured tasks\nMany real-world prompts mix instructions with structured data (tables, JSON, etc.). A structure-aware compressor is a more natural fit than a generic summarizer.\n\n\nIf this works even moderately well, Hieratic could become a core building block for workflows where prompts—not models—are the main bottleneck.\n\nWhy This Might Be a Terrible Idea\nBeing honest about the risks:\n\n\nWe silently destroy task fidelity\n\nThe dangerous failure mode is not “the model throws an error”, it’s “the model quietly stops extracting certain fields.”\nUnder aggressive compression, subtle but important constraints and corner cases can just, disappear.\nResearch like 500xCompressor reports retaining ~62–73% of performance under heavy compression; that may be fine for some tasks, terrifying for others.\n\n\n\nWe overfit to a narrow prompt shape\n\nThe early design assumes prompts that look like:\n\na long instruction block, plus\na structured document (tables, configs, schemas, etc.).\n\n\nIf your prompts are mostly conversational, mostly code, or heavily multimodal, these strategies may not transfer well.\n\n\n\nEvaluation is non-trivial\n\nTo take this seriously, we’ll need:\n\na proper “before vs after compression” benchmark,\nreal extraction and reasoning tasks, not toy examples,\nand metrics beyond “tokens saved” (precision/recall on fields, calibration of failure modes, etc.).\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we’re not disciplined, we’ll end up with a fancy token counter that quietly degrades the very tasks this was supposed to help with.\n\nA Bit of Research Backing\nThis idea borrows from existing work rather than inventing everything from scratch:\n\n\n500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models\nShows that prompts are highly compressible (6×–480×) by learning a compressed “language” while retaining 62–73% of task performance. Key takeaways:\n\nPrompts contain a lot of low-information redundancy.\nYou can compress aggressively if you protect information-bearing tokens.\n→ 500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models\n\n\n\nNAACL 2025 survey on prompt compression\nSurveys extractive vs. abstractive compression and token-pruning strategies, emphasizing:\n\ntrade-offs between compression ratio and task fidelity,\nthe importance of preserving structure for technical prompts.\n→ NAACL 2025 prompt compression survey (PDF)\n\n\n\nFactory.ai – “Compressing Context”\nDescribes a production-ready strategy for incremental, anchored summaries:\n\nmaintain a persistent conversation state,\ncompress only the span that’s about to fall out of context,\navoid repeatedly re-summarizing old history.\n→ Factory.ai: “Compressing Context”\n\n\n\nWhere Hieratic diverges is in deliberately not adding another model to the loop. The goal is a deterministic, rule-based compressor that plays nicely with structured prompts and long-running pipelines.\n\nRough Shape of the System\nHere’s the high-level architecture I’m exploring.\n1. Split instructions vs document\nBefore we drop any tokens:\n\nInstruction block: natural-language instructions and commentary.\nDocument block: structured tables, JSON payloads, grammars, etc.\n\nOnly the instruction block is compressed.\nDocument blocks are treated as verbatim and left untouched.\n2. Pattern extraction &amp; context library (optional)\nGiven a corpus of prompts, a pattern extractor:\n\nscans for frequently repeated fragments (boilerplate instructions, shared scaffolding),\nbuilds a reusable context library,\nallows future prompts to reference those snippets instead of inlining them.\n\nThis is similar in spirit to a learned codebook (as in research like 500xCompressor), but done in a deterministic, human-auditable way.\n3. Extractive compression over instruction blocks\nFor instruction text, the compressor:\n\nSets a token budget based on a compression level (Light, Medium, Aggressive) or explicit target ratio.\nSegments text using structure-aware heuristics:\n\nheadings (#, ##),\n“Definition:”, “Location:”, “Response Format:” markers,\nparameter blocks (Extracted_Value, Doc_Page_Number, etc.).\n\n\nScores segments such that:\n\nhard constraints and response formats are hard-kept,\nexplanatory text and examples are more compressible.\n\n\nImplements a greedy selection: keep highest-scoring segments until the budget is spent.\n\nThe intent is to preserve the “spine” of the instructions while trimming repetition and soft context.\n4. Encode as a Hieratic prompt\nThe compressed result is organized into a Hieratic structure, with sections like:\n\n@ROLE – who the model is supposed to be,\n@TASK – what it’s supposed to do,\n@FOCUS – which fields / behaviors matter most,\n@EXAMPLES – optionally compressed or referenced,\n@RECENT – most recent interaction span,\n@ANCHOR[...] – anchored summaries of older context.\n\nIt’s essentially a compact, structured representation of your original prompt.\n5. Incremental mode for long histories\nIn incremental mode, the compressor:\n\nloads a previous compression state,\nidentifies the “oldest” span that’s about to be evicted from context,\ncompresses that span into a new @ANCHOR[...],\nkeeps the most recent N tokens uncompressed.\n\nOver time, you get a stack of anchors plus a fresh @RECENT tail, keeping context current without growing linearly with the full history.\n\nWhat I’d Love Feedback On\nThis is the experimental part. I’d love to hear from people who:\n\nrun LLMs in production with big prompts,\nhave tried prompt compression in anger,\nor have opinions on where this kind of feature should live in a system like Tokuin.\n\nA few specific questions:\n\n\nEvaluation\n\nHow would you design a real benchmark for this?\nWhich tasks / datasets would you use to prove that we’re not quietly breaking critical behaviors?\n\n\n\nFailure modes\n\nWhere have compression strategies bitten you before?\nAre there patterns or structures you’d mark as “never compress this”?\n\n\n\nIntegration into a stack like Tokuin\n\nAt what layer would you expect to see a feature like this?\n\nRight before the LLM call?\nAs part of a prompt-building pipeline?\nAs a standalone preprocessor with its own cache?\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternatives &amp; trade-offs\n\nWould you lean towards learned compressors instead?\nAre there simpler heuristics that get most of the benefit without this level of complexity?\n\n\n\nProduct shaping\n\nShould this live as:\n\na first-class Tokuin feature,\nan “experimental / power user” option,\nor a separate library that Tokuin can plug into?\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you have opinions—positive or negative—I’d genuinely appreciate hearing them.\n\nHow This Fits Into Tokuin (Right Now)\nAs of today, Hieratic Prompt Compression is experimental and aspirational:\n\nIt’s being explored as a potential feature for Tokuin, not a locked-in roadmap item.\nAny implementation will start as:\n\nan opt-in, feature-flagged module,\nwith clear disclaimers about the risks,\nand tooling to inspect exactly what was compressed.\n\n\n\nLong term, if the idea survives scrutiny, I could imagine:\n\nper-project compression profiles,\nUI/CLI tools for inspecting “before vs after” prompts,\nand tighter integration with context management and retrieval strategies.\n\nBut we’re not there yet. For now, I’m trying to answer a simpler question:\n\nCan a Hieratic-style, rule-based compressor earn its place inside Tokuin, or should we keep prompts uncompressed and invest elsewhere?\n\nIf you’ve navigated similar trade-offs—or you’re just curious and want to poke holes in this idea—I’d love to hear from you.\n\nReferences\n\n\n500xCompressor: Generalized Prompt Compression for Large Language Models\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03094\n\n\nNAACL 2025 Prompt Compression Survey\nhttps://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.368.pdf\n\n\nFactory.ai – “Compressing Context”\nhttps://factory.ai/news/compressing-context\n\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/hieratic-prompt-compression-prototype/","title":"Hieratic Prompt Compression: Ambitious Prototype or Superpower?"},"https://noos.blog/posts/how-embracing-rust-sharpens-the-mind/":{"body":"When you decide to work in Rust, something subtle begins to shift. It’s not just about learning a new syntax or mastering memory safety. It’s about engaging a mode of thinking that demands attention, clarity, and responsibility. In doing so, you develop stronger focus, sharpened critical thinking, and what might best be called responsible individualism. And when one person grows in that way, the ripple effects can touch an entire team or organization.\nIn this post, I’ll explore three interlocking themes:\n\nFocus — how Rust trains sustained, precise attention\nCritical Thinking — how Rust forces richer reasoning and choice\nIndividualism &amp; Contribution — how mastering Rust empowers an individual who then strengthens the whole\n\n\n1. Focus: Cultivating Attention in the Code\nIn many languages, you type, you compile, you run. Mistakes show up in logs or in production. With Rust, the compiler intervenes early and often. You’ll catch ownership issues, borrowing conflicts, lifetime mismatches—not after deployment, but at compile time.\nConsider these moments:\n\nYou borrow a value; you pause and ask: Who currently has access?\nYou annotate a function; you reflect: What lifetimes are involved, and why must this reference stay valid here?\nYou handle a Result&lt;T, E&gt;; you evaluate: What happens when this fails?\n\nThese are micro‑acts of attention. Over time, they build a habit of precision and presence. Rust trains you not to write just-sufficient code—but code you understand and own.\nWhen a developer learns this mode of working, the whole team benefits. Code reviews become richer. Discussions shift from “does it compile?” to “why did this compile, and is this the best way?” The developer’s focus becomes a team asset.\n\n2. Critical Thinking: Building Sound Reasoning\nBeyond focus, Rust forces you into deeper reasoning. Ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, concurrency—they’re not mere mechanics, they’re invitations to think about how your code works, why it is safe, and what assumptions you’re making.\nIn philosophical terms, this resembles the concept of technē—the idea of craft or making, where knowing how to do something is inseparable from knowing why you do it. In programming, Rust becomes a modern technē: you not only write code, you reason about resources, validity, and correctness.\nFor example:\n\nYou ask: “If I pass this borrow here, could someone else modify the data concurrently?”\nYou reason: “If this value moves and the original is used afterward, I invite a compile error. Why does Rust forbid this? What risk is it preventing?”\nYou model: “When threads share Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;, what invariants do I preserve? What could go wrong if I slip up?”\n\nThese questions steer you away from simple feature‑delivery and toward thoughtful system design. And when more developers engage in this kind of thinking, the codebase becomes more robust, maintainable, and predictable.\n\n3. Individualism &amp; Contribution: Mastery That Scales\n“Individualism” often carries negative connotations—but here I mean a positive kind: an individual taking responsibility for their craft, developing depth of understanding, and then choosing to bring that to the group. Rust supports exactly that.\nThe philosophy of software craftsmanship frames development as more than meeting a deadline—it’s about mastery, continuous improvement, and professional pride. When someone invests the time to master Rust’s rule set, they gain both confidence and clarity. They can mentor others, raise standards, and uplift the team.\nIn turn, the team and organization benefit:\n\nDecreased bugs and runtime surprises\nClearer design boundaries and documentation\nA culture where thinking matters and craftsmanship is respected\n\nIn this way, the individual’s growth becomes a catalyst for collective growth. One Rust‑savvy engineer can shift a team’s mindset from “just ship” to “ship well.”\n\nPhilosophical Reflection: Craft, Virtue, and the Common Good\nLet’s step into the philosophical background. In the virtue‑ethics tradition, the focus isn’t only on what you do, but who you become by doing it. When you practise a craft with discipline, you internalize values: care, integrity, attention to detail.\nRust—as a programming language—is more than a tool; it’s a training ground. The rules around ownership and safety aren’t arbitrary; they coax you into a mindset of accountability. That mindset echoes technē: making with purpose, not just automatism.\nAt the same time, contributing to a team, a codebase, or an open ecosystem aligns with the idea of the common good. Technology can be shaped for more than profit—it can serve that which is good, beautiful, and durable.\nPutting those threads together: writing Rust becomes a practice in character as much as a skill in code. You become someone who thinks deeply about structure, consequences, and shared responsibility. And that transformation benefits every person you code with.\n\nConclusion\nWorking with Rust gives you more than faster performance or fewer runtime bugs. It gives you a path to sharpen your focus, refine your thinking, and develop a personal mastery that contributes to something larger than yourself.\nIf you’re a developer seeking to grow not just your output but your way of working, Rust offers a compelling challenge.\nIf you’re a leader or a team building culture, supporting your engineers in learning Rust can become a signal of valuing craft, clarity, and long‑term thinking.\nIn the end, the code we build reflects the minds we train. With Rust, the training is real—and the benefits run deep.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nSoftware Craftsmanship – the movement emphasizing craftsmanship in programming.\nTechne – the Greek philosophical concept of craft and skill.\nJonsson, M.; Tholander, C.

And yes, I'm talking here about terminals in POSIX-compliant OS's, more specifically terminal in a Linux environment.\nAnyhow I will share you the details of my customized terminal configurations so you could get an idea of what it is really capable of doing and perhaps you would start applying the changes to your own terminal.\nSo to make it all happen I had to give up on bash and start using zsh. Because zsh provides some extensive support to terminal users and it is certainly feature rich, customizable  and cooler than bash. So all the customizations I made are based on zsh and oh-my-zsh (a really cool community driven project for managing zsh configurations)\nLooks\nIf looking at theming oh-my-zsh provides some cool and nice looking themes out of the box. But the theme that I'm using is an external theme and needs little bit more configurations before using it.\nIt's call bullet-train and to make it look right I had to install some fonts from Vim-Powerline. I also had to change the color scheme of my terminal to use Solarized (dark). Here I'm using xfce4-terminal that comes with Xubuntu, so I can easily change the color scheme from the preferences menu.

So I built identical ROUGE-L implementations in both languages and ran some benchmarks. The code was AI-generated, the algorithm was the same, and the results were mathematically equivalent. But the performance? That's where it gets interesting.\nWhat is ROUGE-L?\nROUGE-L (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation - Longest Common Subsequence) is a metric used to evaluate text summarization quality. It's part of the ROUGE evaluation suite developed by Chin-Yew Lin in 2004, which has become a standard in natural language processing for assessing how well generated summaries match reference summaries.\nHow it works:\nROUGE-L measures similarity based on the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) between sequences of words. It calculates three metrics:\n\nPrecision: LCS / (number of words in candidate summary)\nRecall: LCS / (number of words in reference summary)\nF-Measure: 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)\n\nThe algorithm uses dynamic programming with O(m × n) time complexity, where m and n are the lengths of the two sequences. It's a straightforward implementation, which makes it a good candidate for comparing language performance.\nROUGE-L is particularly useful because it doesn't require exact word matches—it finds the longest sequence of words that appear in the same order in both texts, making it more flexible than n-gram overlap methods like ROUGE-1 or ROUGE-2.\nThe Setup\nBoth implementations:\n\nUse the same dynamic programming algorithm for LCS calculation\nTokenize text the same way (lowercase, whitespace-based splitting)\nHandle the same 16 test examples across 6 complexity levels\nProduce identical mathematical results\n\nThe only difference is the language they're written in.\nTest scenarios include:\n\nBasic text comparisons\nStructured data (JSON, HTML)\nMixed content with embedded structures\nReal-world technical documentation\n\nYou can find the full comparison project on GitHub.\nThe Results\nAccuracy: Both implementations produced 100% identical results across all 16 test cases. Every F-Measure, Precision, and Recall value matched perfectly. This confirms the algorithms are mathematically equivalent.\nPerformance: That's where things get interesting.\nAfter multiple benchmark runs with 10 iterations each:\nJava:\n\nAverage: 52-62ms per run\nMedian: 51-61ms\nStandard deviation: 1.5-13ms (relatively consistent)\nIncludes JVM startup time in every run\nPerformance stabilizes quickly after first iteration\n\nRust:\n\nAverage: 21-40ms (heavily skewed by first cold start)\nMedian: 2.5-4ms (after warmup)\nFirst iteration: 190-360ms (cold start overhead including compilation)\nWarm average: 2.4-4.4ms (excluding first run)\nStandard deviation: 60-115ms (largely due to cold start variability)\n\nThe speedup: After warmup, Rust was consistently 12-25x faster than Java for this workload. For example, in one run: Java median 56.66ms vs Rust warm average 2.50ms = 24.76x speedup. The median Rust time (2.5-3ms) versus Java's median (52-56ms) tells the story.\nWhat This Means\nFor Java:\n\nJVM startup adds significant overhead (~50-60ms)\nOnce running, performance is consistent\nThe runtime environment is predictable but has a fixed cost\n\nFor Rust:\n\nCold start includes compilation/optimization overhead (~200-350ms)\nOnce warmed up, execution is extremely fast (~2.5-3ms)\nCompiled binary runs without runtime interpretation overhead\n\nThe reality: In production, both would run with warmup periods. Java would maintain its ~55ms average. Rust would settle into its ~2.5-3ms sweet spot. The performance difference would still be substantial.\nObservations\nTradeoffs:\n\n\nStartup time: Java has consistent startup overhead. Rust has a larger initial cold start but negligible warm overhead.\n\n\nConsistency: Java's performance is more predictable from run to run. Rust's cold start variability makes early measurements misleading.\n\n\nWarm performance: Once both are warmed up, Rust's compiled nature provides significant advantages for CPU-bound work.\n\n\nEcosystem: Java has mature NLP libraries. Rust has growing ecosystem support. For this isolated algorithm, both worked well.\n\n\nThe \"just for fun\" part:\nThis was an experiment. I wanted to see what would happen if you took the same algorithm, implemented it identically in two languages, and compared performance. The answer: same results, dramatically different performance characteristics.\nWhy This Matters\nFor production systems evaluating summarization quality:\n\nThroughput matters: Processing thousands of summaries per second benefits from Rust's speed\nLatency matters: If this runs in a request path, 2.5ms vs 55ms is significant\nInfrastructure matters: Java's JVM ecosystem vs Rust's compiled binary have different deployment considerations\n\nNeither is \"better\" in absolute terms. They have different tradeoffs. Understanding those tradeoffs is what matters.\nReferences\n\nLin, C.-Y. (2004).

What you'll need is\n\nLink for the Jar:Kulla.jar\nJava 9 early access JDK\n\nOnce these are in place you just need to set the JAVA_HOME to your / path / to / JDK 9. Then execute the following -jar command:-\n$ java -jar kulla.jar\nYou will be entered in to the JShell.\nHard way\nNOTE: The whole build process can take up to 20-30 minutes or more, so brace yourself.\n\nMake sure you have set the JAVA_HOME\nYou also need Mercurial.

Everything was working fine until I ran cargo check and saw this warning:\n\nThat's not something you want to see. It suggests your code will break in future Rust versions. So naturally, I tried to upgrade the redis crate to a newer version.\nBut here's where things got interesting—every single attempt to upgrade past v0.25.4 broke the build. Not just small errors, but fundamental incompatibilities between the redis crate and deadpool-redis.\nWhat I Tried\nI went through the versions systematically, testing each major release:\n\nv0.26.x: Broke immediately. Missing TcpTls variant in the Tokio enum, internal TLS types incomplete.\nv0.27.x: Same issues as v0.26.x. TLS support partially broken.\nv0.28.x: TLS types like TlsConnParams and TcpTls were still broken internally.\nv0.29.x: Now it requires a connect_tcp_tls trait that deadpool-redis doesn't implement.\nv0.30.x, v0.31.x, v0.32.x: All require the same connect_tcp_tls trait.\n\nThe pattern became clear: somewhere between v0.25.4 and v0.29.0, the redis crate changed how it handles TLS connections, and deadpool-redis hasn't caught up yet.\nThe Root Cause\nThe issue is that redis v0.25.4 is the last version before connect_tcp_tls was introduced. This new trait-based approach is cleaner architecturally, but it requires connection pool libraries to implement this trait. deadpool-redis v0.14.0 was built against the older API and doesn't have this implementation.\nVersions between v0.25.4 and v0.29.0 are in a transitional state—they have some TLS support but it's incomplete or broken.\nCurrent Status\nAfter testing all these versions, I ended up staying with redis v0.25.4. Here's the working configuration:\nCargo.toml:\n\nrust-toolchain.toml:\n\nThe = prefix on the redis version pins it exactly to v0.25.4, preventing accidental upgrades. And pinning Rust to 1.74.1 helps avoid future compatibility warnings.\nThis setup works reliably:\n\nTLS over rediss:// connections work with tokio-rustls\nConnection pooling via deadpool-redis functions correctly\nNo compilation warnings or errors\nStable and predictable behavior\n\nWhat to Avoid\nIf you're in a similar situation, avoid these version combinations:\n\nredis v0.26.x–v0.28.x: TLS support is broken or incomplete. You'll get compilation errors related to missing enum variants or broken TLS types.\nredis &gt;= v0.29.0 with deadpool-redis: Won't compile because deadpool-redis doesn't implement the required connect_tcp_tls trait.\ndeadpool-redis v0.15+: Currently not compatible with stable redis versions due to the same trait mismatch.\n\nAlternative Approach\nIf you really need a newer redis version, you have one option: drop deadpool-redis and use redis's built-in ConnectionManager or switch to a different pooling library like bb8. But this means rewriting your connection pool code, which might not be worth it for most projects.\nThe Future\nThe situation is temporary, but it's unclear when it will be resolved. The deadpool-redis maintainers need to either:\n\nImplement the connect_tcp_tls trait for newer redis versions, or\nUpdate their API to work with the new connection model\n\nUntil then, staying with redis v0.25.4 and deadpool-redis v0.14.0 is the most stable path forward. Yes, you'll see that deprecation warning, but it's better than having broken code.\nBottom Line\nSometimes upgrading dependencies isn't the right move. In this case, the ecosystem has a compatibility gap between redis and deadpool-redis, and staying on the older version is the pragmatic choice. The warning is annoying, but it's not breaking anything right now—and when the ecosystem catches up, you can upgrade then.\nIf you're building a new project and need Redis with TLS and pooling, consider whether you can use redis's built-in ConnectionManager instead of deadpool-redis. If you're maintaining an existing project, stick with what works: redis v0.25.4 and deadpool-redis v0.14.0.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/redis-tls-deadpool-compatibility/","title":"Redis, TLS, and Deadpool: When Dependency Versions Collide"},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-macros-vs-functions/":{"body":"The Question\nWhen you first start with Rust, one thing that throws you off is the difference between macros and functions. Coming from Java or Python, this seems odd—why would you need both?\nWhat's the Difference?\nHere's the simplest explanation: functions work on data, macros work on code.\nIn Python, you write:\n\nIn Java, you write:\n\nBoth run at runtime—when your program executes.\nBut in Rust, macros run at compile time—before your code is even compiled. They're code that writes code.\nA Simple Example\nFunction in Rust:\n\nMacro in Rust:\n\nWhen you call the macro add!(1, 2), the compiler literally rewrites your code to 1 + 2 before compiling. It's like a smart find-and-replace.\nWhy Not Just Use Functions?\nMacros solve problems that functions can't:\n1. Variable Arguments\nEver wonder how println! can take any number of arguments?\n\nThat's because it's a macro. Functions need fixed signatures; macros can accept variable patterns.\n2. Code Generation\nPython has decorators like @dataclass that generate code for you:\n\nJava has annotations like @Override or Lombok's @Builder.\nIn Rust, this is done with macros:\n\nThe derive macro generates Debug and Clone implementations automatically.\n3. Domain-Specific Languages (DSL)\nA DSL is a miniature language tailored to a specific problem domain. Think of SQL—it's not a general-purpose language, but a specialized one for databases.\nYou can create custom syntax with macros:\n\nThis isn't valid Rust code—it's an HTML-like DSL that the macro converts into valid Rust. It lets you write HTML templates directly in your Rust code, which the macro transforms into function calls and data structures at compile time.\nMental Model for Java/Python Developers\nConceptPython/JavaRust\nFunctionNormal code that runsSame—runs at runtime\nAnnotation/Decorator@Override, @dataclass#[derive(...)] macro\nMacroDoesn't really existGenerates code at compile time\n\nThink of macros as super-powered annotations. In Java, annotations can generate some code (like Lombok does), but macros can generate any code.\nWhen to Use What?\n\nUse functions for normal logic and calculations.\nUse macros when you want to avoid boilerplate, create custom syntax, or generate code automatically.\n\nBottom Line\nMacros are Rust's way of reducing repetition and enabling metaprogramming. They run before compilation and rewrite your code. If you're coming from Java or Python, think of them as annotations or decorators on steroids—but they can do much more.\nFor most beginners, you don't need to write macros. The standard library macros like println!, vec!, and format! will carry you far.

Then someone suggests \"why not just use a prompt?\"\nYou don't need to explain why that won't work. The industry has already documented what happens when prototypes become production.\nWhy Not Just Give an Opinion?\nThere's a temptation to push back when surface-level decisions ignore architecture, scalability, edge cases, and maintainability. But opinions based on current trends or individual preferences don't help. They just add noise.\nThe current landscape is filled with quick takes and hot takes. Everyone has an opinion, often shaped more by what's trending than by systematic thinking. Narcissistic individualism—the idea that one person's perspective matters more than collective experience—creates an environment where strong opinions win even when they're wrong.\nThe problem isn't trends themselves. It's choosing tools or approaches because they're trending, rather than because they solve real problems. The distinction matters.\nResearch and data exist. Patterns repeat. The industry has documented what works and what doesn't. Why add another opinion when we can point to what's already been proven?\nThat's why this isn't about pushing back with opinions. It's about pointing to what the industry already knows: prototypes that skip architecture rarely become production systems. The data is public. The patterns are clear.\nThe Statistics\nAccording to recent research, 87% of machine learning models never make it past the prototype stage. Reasons include technical debt, edge cases that break everything, scale issues, and maintainability collapses.\nWhy \"Just a Prompt\" Rarely Works\nWhen you build a direct LLM solution, you're coding logic into prompts. This creates brittleness—small changes require rewriting entire prompts. It's impossible to debug—you can't see intermediate steps. And there's no observability—production needs monitoring, logging, and metrics that a single prompt can't provide.\nWhat Actually Ships\nAI systems that reach production are rarely \"just a prompt.\" They have structured workflows, error handling, observability, modularity, and scalability. These frameworks and architectures exist because production systems need structure—not because they're trendy, but because they solve real problems that prototypes ignore.\nThe Numbers Don't Lie\n\nGartner: Over 80% of organizations will struggle to operationalize AI systems by 2026\nMIT Sloan: 85% experiment with AI, but only 37% deploy at scale\nHarvard Business Review: \"Failure to move beyond proof of concept\" is the primary cause of AI failures\n\nArchitecture matters. Prototypes skip it. Production requires it.\nThe Hard Truth\nThere's a mismatch between demos and production. Prototypes optimize for speed. Production optimizes for reliability, scalability, and maintainability.\nThe question isn't whether your prototype works. It's whether it works when you have 100x more users, need unanticipated features, or an edge case breaks everything.\nPrototypes optimize for the first week.

Strict Type System\nRust's type system is precise, and it expects you to be explicit about what types you're working with. There's no silent coercion between mismatched types. This can feel rigid at first, but it eliminates entire classes of bugs you'd otherwise only see at runtime.\nExample: Type mismatch\n\nRust won't implicitly convert between u32 and i32. You'll need to cast it explicitly:\n\nThis forces you to make conversion decisions intentionally and not by accident.\n\n2. Error Handling: No Exceptions\nRust does not have exceptions. Instead, it uses the Result&lt;T, E&gt; and Option&lt;T&gt; types for fallible operations. You must explicitly handle errors or propagate them. Ignoring them is not allowed.\nExample: Required handling of Result\n\nTo resolve this, you can either handle the error:\n\nOr propagate it using the ? operator in a function that returns a Result:\n\nThis enforces a programming style where failure is expected and dealt with.\n\n3. Immutability by Default\nVariables are immutable unless explicitly marked otherwise. This encourages predictability and thread-safety, even in single-threaded contexts.\nExample: Immutable variable\n\nThe correct way:\n\nThis simple rule helps reduce bugs from unintended mutation, especially in shared state.\n\n4. Ownership and Move Semantics\nRust enforces a unique ownership model. Every value in Rust has a single owner, and when that owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped. You can move ownership, borrow it temporarily, or clone the data.\nExample: Moved value error\n\nOnce ownership is transferred, you can no longer use the original. This prevents bugs like double-free or use-after-free that are common in C/C++.\n\n5. Borrowing Rules\nInstead of transferring ownership, you can borrow references. Borrowing can be either immutable (&amp;T) or mutable (&amp;mut T), but Rust enforces strict rules:\n\nYou can have multiple immutable borrows at the same time.\nOr one mutable borrow.\nBut not both.\n\nThis is enforced at compile time.\nInvalid example: Two mutable borrows\n\nThe compiler ensures that you never access memory from multiple places in ways that could cause race conditions or undefined behavior.\n\n6. Lifetimes\nLifetimes are Rust's way of tracking how long references are valid. The compiler uses lifetimes to prevent dangling references.\nExample: Dangling reference (compile error)\n\nRust will reject this code, saving you from accessing freed memory. Often, you'll write explicit lifetime annotations in function signatures when dealing with multiple references.\n\n7. Concurrency Without Data Races\nRust prevents data races at compile time using its ownership and borrowing rules. When you need to share mutable state between threads, you must use thread-safe abstractions like Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;T&gt;&gt;.\nExample: Thread-safe counter\n\nIn many other languages, this would compile fine but possibly fail at runtime. In Rust, the compiler ensures that shared state is accessed safely.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nRust asks a lot from the developer upfront. You'll be forced to think about ownership, lifetimes, mutability, and error paths very early in the process. But once your code compiles, it's often rock-solid. You'll find fewer runtime crashes, undefined behaviors, or memory leaks.\nMore importantly, Rust helps you develop habits that transfer to any language: understanding lifecycles, reducing shared mutable state, and always considering failure cases.\nAdditional Resources\n\nThe Rust Book\nRust by Example\nRustlings: Interactive CLI Exercises\ncheats.rs: Rust best practices\n\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/","title":"Why Rust Makes You a Better Engineer"},"https://noos.blog/posts/zola-about-page-puzzle/":{"body":"The Goal\nI wanted to add an About page to my blog. Simple enough, right? Create content/about.md, add it to the navigation menu, and done.\nWrong.\nThe Problem\nI created the About page, updated the navigation, and ran zola build. Instead of a clean build, I got this:\n\nThe page wasn't being built at all. But wait—why does an About page need a date? It's not a blog post.\nThe Investigation\nThe issue was in my content/_index.md file:\n\nSee that sort_by = \"date\"? That was the culprit. According to Zola's documentation, when you set sort_by = \"date\" in a section's front matter, all pages in that section must have a date field. Pages without the required field are ignored during rendering and a warning is displayed.\nThis is documented behavior, but it's easy to miss when you're just trying to add a simple About page.\nThe Solution\nThe fix had two parts:\nStep 1: Add a date field to the About page. Since the root section uses sort_by = \"date\", all pages need a date—even non-post pages.\nStep 2: Hide the date from displaying on the About page using show_date = false in the front matter.\nBefore:\n\nAfter:\n\nI also had to create a custom templates/macros/post_macros.html to override the theme's default meta macro and respect the show_date flag. But the front matter solution is the important part.\nNow the About page builds correctly, appears in the correct order for pagination, but doesn't display the awkward \"Published: 2025-01-01\" meta.\nThe Lesson\nRoot-level sections in Zola behave differently than you might think. If you set sort_by = \"date\" in a section, all pages in that section must have a date field—even non-post pages like About pages.\nWhile Zola's docs mention this behavior, it's the kind of detail that's easy to gloss over when you're focused on building features. The solution is straightforward:\n\nGive every page a date if your section sorts by date (I use 2025-01-01 for static pages)\nUse a custom macro override to conditionally hide dates where they don't make sense\n\nFor static pages like About, seeing \"Published: 2025-01-01\" is awkward, so the show_date = false flag was essential.\nQuick Check\nIf you're having similar issues with Zola pages not building:\n\nCheck your section's _index.md for sort_by directives\nMake sure all pages in that section have the required fields\nUse show_date = false in front matter if you want to hide dates on static pages\nConsider moving sorted content to a dedicated subsection\n\nSometimes the simplest fixes are the most unexpected. And sometimes you need two fixes instead of one.\n","id":"https://noos.blog/posts/zola-about-page-puzzle/","title":"The Zola About Page Puzzle: When Root Sections Bite Back"}},"docInfo":{"https://noos.blog/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://noos.blog/about/":{"body":252,"title":0},"https://noos.blog/posts/":{"body":11,"title":1},"https://noos.blog/posts/a-simple-word-definition-script/":{"body":105,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/ai-covers-on-autopilot/":{"body":444,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/amazon-ws-ec2-connect-via-ssh-rsa/":{"body":307,"title":7},"https://noos.blog/posts/connecting-dots/":{"body":226,"title":2},"https://noos.blog/posts/cursor-payments-confusion/":{"body":191,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/gh-actions-charges/":{"body":489,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/github-actions-when-automation-meets-reality/":{"body":1118,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/google-go-on-opensuse-12-1/":{"body":271,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/hieratic-prompt-compression-prototype/":{"body":1096,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/how-embracing-rust-sharpens-the-mind/":{"body":533,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/how-my-terminal-looks/":{"body":269,"title":2},"https://noos.blog/posts/java-vs-rust-rouge-l-performance/":{"body":578,"title":7},"https://noos.blog/posts/jaxb-maven-xml-to-java/":{"body":139,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/jdk-9-and-jshell/":{"body":275,"title":3},"https://noos.blog/posts/linux-fancy-little-dialog-utility/":{"body":43,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/mock-api-framework-shell-scripts/":{"body":153,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/opensuse-13-1-almost-here/":{"body":74,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/redis-tls-deadpool-compatibility/":{"body":405,"title":6},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-macros-vs-functions/":{"body":298,"title":8},"https://noos.blog/posts/rust-serde-datetime-deserialization-error/":{"body":154,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/tokuin-token-tooling-for-llm-builders/":{"body":485,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/when-prototypes-become-production/":{"body":314,"title":5},"https://noos.blog/posts/why-rust-makes-you-better-engineer/":{"body":412,"title":4},"https://noos.blog/posts/zola-about-page-puzzle/":{"body":259,"title":7}},"length":27},"lang":"English"}
